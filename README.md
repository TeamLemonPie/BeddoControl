### Main Features

#### Players
- create new players
- set player properties
  - name
  - twitch name
  - seat (a seat is a position at the poker table with a corresponding NFC reader that is connected to a BeddoFabrik)
  - remaining chips
  - manage card ID (A manage card can be used to assign a new seat to a player. This is accomplished by placing the manage card for a player on a certain NFC reader at the table. The seat is then automatically assigned to the player the manage card corresponds to.)
- toggle player status
  - active (show in overlay)
  - fold (hide in overlay)
  - out of game (no chips remaining; hide in overlay)
  - highlight (Indicates whether the player is on the turn.)
- see the calculated win probability for all players

- delete players

#### Board
- see all scanned public cards
- clear all scanned public cards (replaces the cards with default images in the overlay and sends a clear command to all connected BeddoFabrik systems.)
- manually set cards for all five board positions (This is useful if a NFC scanner fails to detect one or more cards. In order to manually set board cards the BeddoControl operator needs to see a top view of the poker table to recognize the cards.)

In addition this timer will be shown in some of the overlays provided by BeddoMischer for the audience.)
